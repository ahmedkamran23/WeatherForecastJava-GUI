# 🌦 Simple Weather App (Java GUI)

A beginner-friendly Java project built for my **Programming Fundamentals (1st Semester)** course.  
This app allows users to enter a city name and view the current weather information, while also saving their search history to a local file.  
It’s a great example of file handling, GUI design, and API integration for students learning the basics of programming.
